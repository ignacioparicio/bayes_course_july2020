Most introductory courses, particularly for non-statisticians, still do not cover Bayesian methods at all, except perhaps to derive Bayes' formula as a trivial rearrangement of the definition of conditional probability. Even today, Bayesian courses are typically tacked onto the curriculum, rather than being integrated into the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The data that have been observed are considered **random**, because they are realizations of random processes, and hence will vary each time one goes to observe the system.\n",
    "- Model parameters are considered **fixed**. The parameters' values are unknown, but they are fixed, and so we *condition* on them.\n",

    "Here, the model $f$ accepts data values $y$ as an argument, conditional on particular values of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentist inference typically involves deriving **estimators** for the unknown parameters. Estimators are formulae that return estimates for particular estimands, as a function of data. They are selected based on some chosen optimality criterion, such as *unbiasedness*, *variance minimization*, or *efficiency*.\n",
    "\n",

    "The process of conducting Bayesian inference can be broken down into three general steps (Gelman *et al.* 2013):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/123.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",

    "This step involves making choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the form of the sampling distribution of the data?\n",
    "- what form best describes our uncertainty in the unknown parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate a posterior distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical form $p(\\theta | y)$ that we associated with the Bayesian approach is referred to as a **posterior distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> posterior /pos·ter·i·or/ (pos-tēr´e-er) later in time; subsequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why posterior? Because it tells us what we know about the unknown $\\theta$ *after* having observed $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis. Various strategies for doing so comprise this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",

    "- predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- does the model fit data?\n",
    "- are the conclusions reasonable?\n",
    "- are the outputs sensitive to changes in model structure?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Binomial model is suitable for data that are generated from a sequence of exchangeable Bernoulli trials. These data can be summarized by $y$, the number of times the event of interest occurs, and $n$, the total number of trials. The model parameter is the expected proportion of trials that an event occurs.\n",

    "$$p(Y|\\theta) = \\frac{n!}{y! (n-y)!} \\theta^{y} (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$$\n",

    "where $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $p \\in [0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform Bayesian inference, we require the specification of a prior distribution. A reasonable choice is a uniform prior on [0,1] which has two implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. makes all probability values equally probable *a priori* \n",
    "2. makes calculation of the posterior easy\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task in performing Bayesian inference is, given a fully-specified model, to calculate a posterior distribution. As we have specified the model, we can calculate a posterior distribution up to a proportionality constant (that is, a probability distribution that is **unnormalized**):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | n, y) \\propto P(y | n, \\theta) P(\\theta) = \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$$\n",
